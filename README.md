# NativeScript for Angular Mobile Development
This is the code repository for [NativeScript for Angular Mobile Development](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/nativescript-angular-mobile-development?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787125766), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
NativeScript is an open source framework to build truly native mobile apps with Angular, TypeScript, or even good ole’ plain JavaScript. The most important aspect is that it allows your views to be rendered as real native UI components “native” to iOS or Android, which offer superior performance with fluid usability. This decoupling of the view rendering layer created the powerful combination that is the exciting new world of Angular Native.

This book focuses on the key concepts you need to know to build an Angular Native mobile app for iOS and Android. We’ll build a fun music app “NgNativeMusic”, touching on the powerful native key concepts you need to know when you start building an app of your own. Having the right structure is critical to developing an app that can scale while also being highly maintainable and portable, so we’ll start with project organization via @NgModule. We’ll use @Component to build our first view and then use @Injectable to define a service we can use via Angular’s dependency injection.

You’ll understand NativeScript’s tns command-line utility to run the app on iOS and Android. We’ll integrate third-party plugins to construct some of the core features. Next we’ll integrate @ngrx store + effects to establish some solid practices (Redux) to deal with state management. Having a great data flow and solid architecture is meaningless if the app doesn’t look good or offer a great user experience, so we’ll use SASS to develop a style for our app. After that, we’ll deal with and debug problems and invest some time into writing tests to prevent bugs in the future. Lastly, we’ll package and deploy our app to the Apple App Store and Google Play.

By the end of the book, you’ll know the majority of the key concepts needed to build an Angular Native app.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
[default]
public init() {
 const item = {};
 item.volume = 1;
 }
```
